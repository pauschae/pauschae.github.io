Hi!
I am a researcher in Applied Microeconomics focusing on Behavioral Industrial Organization and Cultural/Institutional Economics.
I research how social relationships interact with economic institutions. 

I will be on the 2022/23 job market and available for interviews in December and January.

You can reach me at `paul.schaefer@uni-bonn.de`.

You can find my CV [here](https://pauschae.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

[The Effect of Social Networks on Market Efficiency](https://pauschae.github.io/files/jmp_pi_schaefer.pdf)
  
I examine the impact of friendships on imperfectly competitive markets. First, I conduct a laboratory experiment to estimate the causal effect of real-world friendships on market prices and efficiency. 
Second, I use the experimental data to test a general model of friendships among sellers in markets with substitutes and complements. 
Like collusion, friendships among sellers of substitutes increase prices and decrease efficiency, whereas friendships between sellers of complements decrease prices and increase efficiency. 
My empirical results indicate that common-ownership models can be applied to study friendships in markets.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
When firms exploit behavioral biases it is natural to think that, eventually, consumers will learn to avoid their mistakes, which limits exploitation. Profit maximizing firms, however, have an incentive to undermine such learning. We study these learning dynamics in a multi-unit descending price auction setting with a simultaneous fixed price offer. We analyze 8 million bids from over 280.000 unique bidders in retail auctions. Consumers frequently bid more than the fixed price offered by the same seller. Depending on rival bidders actions, those overbids sometimes lead to paying more than the fixed price (overpaying). We argue overpaying increases saliency of the consumersâ€™ mistake by making it payoff relevant and thereby may effect consumer learning. Indeed, bidders who overpaid subsequently overbid less often and are more likely to refrain from submitting a bid compared to bidders who overbid but did not overpay. Methodologically, we discuss identification of our treatment effects using causal graphs and show how these treatment effects identify a three-type structural model of bidder behavior with learning dynamics.

[Norm Prevalence and Interdependence: Evidence from a Large-Scale Historical Survey of German speaking Villages](https://www.econtribute.de/RePEc/ajk/ajkdps/ECONtribute_118_2021.pdf)

<summary>Abstract</summary>
We use large-scale survey data of German speaking villages from the 1930's to investigate drivers of cooperation, gender, and religious norms. Through geographic cluster analysis, we show that inter-regional variation explains only little heterogeneity in norms. Villages in the same physical and institutional environment still maintain different norms. We argue that local differences in the structure of social relationships can explain intra-regional heterogeneity in norms. We focus on a community's ability to transmit and enforce norms to derive theoretical links between correlates of community social relationships and the number of norms it maintains (norm prevalence). Empirically we find that: (1) norm prevalence is positively related to three correlates of community social relationships: religiously homogeneous villages, villages that border on other villages with a different majority religion, and villages with more within-village social gatherings; (2) villages with stronger community-level social relationships are also less likely to segment their reference group for the cooperation norm to smaller social units; (3) cooperation norms make other norms more likely.
